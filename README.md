## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.ibb.co/WtjGsGC/immagine-2023-05-28-110526346.png)
My italian version of the famous Wordle game. I have worked on it on my own, applying all my skills to obtain the best result. I am still working on it because it has a lot of bugs right now but I hope to finish it soon!

Some game features:

* 2k+ words chosen randomically each time
* Dark/Light theme to enjoy in multiple ways the game
* Streak counter to show to your friends how skilled you are!

## Built With

To achive this result I mostly used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Getting Started

Just click on the demo link and enjoy the game!

## Usage

You have to guess a 5 letter word in 5 attempts. For each word you will know if a letter is correct and it is in the right position (green background), if it is correct but it is not in the right position (yellow background) or if it is not correct (grey background). Guess the word to win and obtain 1 point!

## Roadmap
